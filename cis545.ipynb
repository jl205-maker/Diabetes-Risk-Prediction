        "This project aims to develop an interpretable model that helps people better understand the key factors associated with diabetes and prediabetes. As healthcare continues to play an increasingly central role in people's lives, we hope our work offers meaningful insights into how behavioral, lifestyle, and socio-demographic variables contribute to chronic disease risk. By applying supervised machine learning techniques and big data analytics, this study highlights the importance of modifiable behaviors and social determinants in early disease detection and prevention.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our primary dataset is the `CDC Diabetes Health Indicators` dataset from `UCI Machine Learning` Repository, which contains responses from 253,680 U.S. adults who participated in the `CDC BRFSS 2014 survey`. The dataset includes a wide range of features such as `BMI`, `blood pressure`, `cholesterol levels`, `smoking habits`, `physical activity`, `diet`, `mental` and `physical` health, and demographic information including `age`, `sex`, `education`, and `income`. Leveraging these variables, we will build a transparent and practical machine learning model that predicts an individual's risk of diabetes or prediabetes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the predictive model, this study provides a reproducible framework that can be extended to broader public health datasets. The goal is to support both patients and healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and promoting targeted, preventative interventions."

Worse general health shows the highest positive correlation with diabetes, followed by high blood pressure, difficulty walking, elevated BMI, and high cholesterol, indicating that cardiometabolic conditions cluster together in individuals with diabetes. Age, history of heart disease or heart attack, poorer physical health, and stroke also show moderate positive associations, reflecting increased vulnerability in older adults and those with cardiovascular complications. In contrast, lifestyle and socioeconomic factors tend to correlate negatively with diabetes. Higher levels of physical activity, greater fruit and vegetable consumption, and higher education and income levels are associated with lower diabetes prevalence, with income showing one of the strongest protective relationships. Overall, these results highlight the combined influence of metabolic health, functional limitations, lifestyle choices, and socioeconomic status in shaping diabetes risk within the population."

Specifically, we **retained BMI values between the 0.5th and 99.5th percentiles** and excluded values outside this range. This method preserves the realistic distribution of BMI while eliminating biologically improbable extremes that could distort model training.

        "### **Summary of Findings**\n",
        "1.  **Target Imbalance:** The dataset is heavily imbalanced, with only ~14% of observations representing diabetic cases. This finding necessitates specific modeling strategies, such as using **Class Weights** (e.g., `scale_pos_weight` in XGBoost or `class_weight='balanced'` in Logistic Regression) and prioritizing metrics like **Recall** and **ROC-AUC** over simple Accuracy.\n",
        "2.  **Correlation Correlations:**\n",
        "    * **Positive Correlations:** `GenHlth` (General Health), `HighBP` (High Blood Pressure), and `BMI` have the strongest positive correlations with diabetes. Note that since `GenHlth` scales 1-5 (Excellent to Poor), a positive correlation confirms that poorer self-reported health links to diabetes.\n",
        "    * **Negative Correlations:** `Income`, `Education`, and `PhysActivity` act as protective factors (negative correlation).\n",
        "3.  **Data Integrity:** `BMI` contained extreme outliers (up to 98), which were filtered using percentile capping to prevent skewing distance-based models.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Updated Project Roadmap**\n",
        "Based on these insights, the modeling phase will proceed as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Baseline Model (Logistic Regression):** We will establish a baseline using a linear classifier with class weights to handle the imbalance.\n",
        "2.  **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):** Due to multicollinearity among health metrics (e.g., `PhysHlth` vs `GenHlth`), we will test if PCA improves model stability, though we risk losing interpretability.\n",
        "3.  **Feature Engineering:** We will create domain-specific features (e.g., `CardioRiskScore`) to capture the interaction between comorbidities (BP, Cholesterol) which EDA showed are clustered together.\n",
        "4.  **Patient Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning):** We will employ K-Means clustering to uncover latent patient archetypes (risk profiles) and use these clusters as new features to capture complex multi-dimensional patterns.\n",
        "5.  **Non-Linear Models (XGBoost & Random Forest):** Since health risks often have thresholds (non-linear relationships), we will deploy tree-based models which generally handle ordinal data and interactions better than logistic regression."

Although tree-based models such as `Random Forest` and `XGBoost` are generally insensitive to feature scaling, `logistic regression` is highly affected by differences in feature magnitude because it relies on gradient-based optimization. Scaling ensures that all features contribute proportionally to the model, prevents variables with larger numeric ranges from dominating the loss function, and improves convergence when using class weights. For consistency across models and to maintain a uniform preprocessing pipeline, the validation and test sets were transformed using the scaler fitted only on the training data to avoid data leakage. This standardized scaling process helps stabilize training and ensures fair comparison across all three classifiers."

After applying PCA to retain 95% of the variance, the logistic regression model trained on the PCA-transformed features showed small improvements in `accuracy`, `precision`, and `recall`, with an `F1-score` of 0.441. However, PCA resulted in a slight decrease in `ROC-AUC` (0.820), indicating a reduction in the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative cases. Overall, PCA provided only **marginal performance gains while sacrificing interpretability**. These results motivated the development of a third model using domain-informed engineered features, with the goal of achieving stronger predictive performance while preserving clinical interpretability."

This loss of interpretability limited our ability to explain which factors contribute most to diabetes risk, an essential consideration for real-world applications.

The baseline model trained on the raw cleaned dataset achieved solid performance with a ROC-AUC of 0.823. Applying PCA produced small gains in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, although ROC-AUC decreased slightly to 0.820, indicating that PCA did not meaningfully improve the model’s discriminative ability while substantially reducing interpretability. Finally, the model trained on the engineered feature dataset achieved performance nearly identical to the baseline model (ROC-AUC 0.823), demonstrating that domain-informed composite features and interaction terms can maintain competitive predictive power without sacrificing interpretability. While PCA offered marginal improvements in some metrics, the engineered model provides a more clinically meaningful and transparent representation of diabetes risk factors, making it the more practical choice despite comparable performance."

XGBoost performs the best because its boosting framework allows each tree to correct the errors of the previous one, enabling the model to gradually learn nonlinear patterns and higher-order feature interactions. In our dataset—which includes health behaviors, metabolic indicators, and lifestyle variables—the relationships among features are far from linear. XGBoost can capture these subtle interactions more effectively, which explains why it achieves the highest Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC scores. In contrast, although Random Forest is also tree-based, each tree is trained independently, without the sequential error-correcting mechanism of boosting. This makes it less capable of modeling complex patterns, resulting in slightly lower overall performance. Logistic Regression, though the simplest model, still performs consistently well, especially after incorporating engineered features that carry clinical meaning. While it cannot learn nonlinear relationships, its linear structure provides strong interpretability, making it particularly useful for identifying key risk factors. Therefore, XGBoost offers the best predictive performance, Random Forest ranks slightly lower, and Logistic Regression remains valuable for its transparency and interpretability."
